## 📖 What is AkiraOS?

AkiraOS is a production-ready embedded operating system that enables **secure, dynamic application execution** on resource-constrained devices through WebAssembly.

### Core Features

✅ **Zero-Trust Execution** - WASM sandboxing + capability-based access control  
✅ **Real-Time Performance** - Zephyr RTOS with <60ns native call overhead  
✅ **AOT Compilation** - Optional native code execution (10-50x faster than interpreter)  
✅ **OTA Updates** - MCUboot secure firmware updates with rollback  
✅ **Multi-Platform** - ESP32, nRF54, STM32, native simulation  
✅ **Modular Connectivity** - WiFi, Bluetooth, USB, mesh (future)  
✅ **Rich SDK** - Display, input, sensors, RF, storage, networking, and system APIs  

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Native Call Overhead | ~60ns |
| WASM Load Time (100KB) | ~80ms |
| Concurrent Apps | 4 instances |
| Memory Per App | 64-128KB configurable |
| Boot Time | ~500ms (ESP32-S3) |
