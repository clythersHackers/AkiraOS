## Custom Hardware

AkiraOS can run on custom hardware. OEM porting resources:

- [**Porting Guide**](porting-guide.md) — end-to-end walkthrough: BSP files, display, WASM runtime, OTA, and a day-by-day week plan to first running app.
- [**BSP Template Scaffold**](../../boards/template/) — copy-and-rename starting point with FIXME markers for GPIO, SPI, I2C, PSRAM, display, and flash partitions.

### Using AkiraOS as a west module

Third-party projects can import AkiraOS without forking:

```yaml
# your-project/west.yml
manifest:
  projects:
    - name: akira-os
      url: https://github.com/your-org/AkiraOS.git
      revision: v1.5.6
      path: akira-os
  self:
    path: my-app
```

After `west update`, board definitions, DTS bindings, Kconfig symbols, and the
full WASM runtime are available automatically — no `-DMODULE_EXT_ROOT` needed.
